      <h2>THIS IS AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE</h2>
      <p>In geometry, an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. <br>
        Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes <br>
        as having at least two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the <br>
        equilateral triangle as a special case. Examples of isosceles triangles include the <br>
        isosceles right triangle, the golden triangle, and the faces of bipyramids and certain <br>
        Catalan solids.</p>
