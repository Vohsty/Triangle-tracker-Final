      <h2>THIS IS AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE</h2>
      <p>In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.<br>
        In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is,<br>
        all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°. It is also a <br>
        regular polygon, so it is also referred to as a regular triangle.</p>
